title: This is how you should start with Clean Code ...
description: |
  Clean Code already starts when reading code. In fact, whenever you starting reading code
  in order to change it later on, think of doing a code review. In this video I want to show
  you some simple refactorings you can already apply while reading existing code.

As a software craftsman Clean Code is one of my key interests so I started a YouTube channel 
to provide practical coding tutorials on how to apply Clean Code principles.

In my first video I demonstrate that Clean Code does not only start when you write a new 
component or add a new feature to some existing code base. Instead you can start applying 
Clean Code principles and especially the Boy Scout Rule already while reading code.

Even though it was written 50 years ago, if you’re a software engineer and haven’t read this book yet,
**put it on top of your reading stack**.
*The Mythical Man-Month* is one of those timeless engineering classics every developer should read at least once in their career.

In his book, Frederick P. Brooks analyzes how software engineering worked back in 1975 —
with a strong focus on productivity and complexity.
As an engineering manager, he was deeply concerned with one central question:
**Why is software development so difficult, and why do so many projects fail?**

What’s fascinating is that — even though our industry has changed massively over the past 50 years —
**many of his observations are still true today.**

Here are a few examples of his most striking claims:

> I will contend that conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design.
> It is better to have a system omit certain anomalous features and improvements, but to reflect one set of design ideas,
> than to have one that contains many good but independent and uncoordinated ideas.

> A small sharp team is best - as few minds as possible.

> The second is the most dangerous system a person ever designs;
> the general tendency is to over-design it.

> The manager of a project needs to establish a philosophy and set aside resources
> for the building of common tools, and at the same time to recognize the need for personalized tools.

And of course, the classic Brooks’s Law:

> Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.

Some weeks back I watched this talk by Adam Tornhill

[Seven Secrets of Maintainable Codebases ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oDporwhToQ)

I was fascinated by the ideas he presented about understanding our code base by analyzing how we interact with it instead of looking 
at the plain source code alone.


Finally i bought the book and found time to read it:

[Your Code As a Crime Scene](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Code-Crime-Scene-Bottlenecks/dp/1680500384/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1487424204&sr=8-1&keywords=Your+Code+As+a+Crime+Scene)


And the only thing I can say is:

**Shutdown your SONAR instance, buy a copy of this book and read it in 24h!**

It will open your eyes.

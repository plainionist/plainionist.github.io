[F# Deep Dives](https://www.amazon.com/F-Deep-Dives-Tomas-Petricek/dp/1617291323/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483706640&sr=8-1&keywords=f%23+deep+dives)

It is a great book about F#!

While it will NOT give you much details about cool latest features of F# language it does give you deep insights in how experienced F# developers
use the benefits of F# in real world projects.

A must read for every developer being interested in more quality with less code and more fun.

## Structure of the book

After having set the foundation of behavior, change and habits the main content
is structured into four chapters, the "four rules of behavioral change".

The rules to create a good habit are:

1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy
4. Make it satisfying

The rules to break a bad habit are:

1. Make it invisible
2. Make it unattractive
3. Make it difficult
4. Make it unsatisfying

Each chapter provide easy to understand explanation what the rule is about
including examples the reader can relate to as well as techniques to implement
the rule daily life.

### Technique: Habit stacking

One such powerful and easy to implement technique is "habit stacking"
which is a strategy to pair a new habit with an existing one.

**Example:** After I got my second coffee, I perform all open code reviews.

### Technique: Temptation bundling

"Temptation bundling" is a technique to make a habit more attractive.
The strategy is to pair an action you *want* to do with an action you *need* to do.

**Example:** After I have reviewed the next chapter of the developer manual (need),
I try out the cool, new library I have found (want).

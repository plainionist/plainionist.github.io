This week I had a discussion with a colleague of mine about stakeholder conform communication.
The content of the discussion reminded me about the "2. Habit: Begin with the end in mind".

This habit is one of seven from Stephen Convey's great book "[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1451639619/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1516449751&sr=8-3&keywords=7+habits)".

The book is the best book I have ever read about personal and organizational success.

In this book Stephen presents seven habits:

1. Be proactive
2. Begin with the end in mind
3. Put first things first
4. Think win-win
5. Seek first to understand, then to be understood
6. Synergize
7. Sharpen the saw

I guess the habits alone already give you a clue what they are about and so I will leave it up the Stephen to explain the details - 
he anyhow can do this much better than me ;-)

My conclusion: You want to be a professional XYZ? Read this book! (at least once every 2 to 4 years ...)

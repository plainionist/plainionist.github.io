So I did exactly this. I bought this book (second edition) and started by Rust journey.

The book is well organized, starting with the most basic concepts and then gradually adds more
and more advanced concepts of the Rust programming language.

It is written in a style that even if you haven't learned any programming language before, you can
follow the explanations and learn programming using Rust.

If you are already familiar with other programming languages like C#, C++ or even F# you can easily
relate to some of the concepts presented while others will probably very new.

So in summary, this book is definitively a great start to learn Rust,
as beginner as well as an experienced software developer!

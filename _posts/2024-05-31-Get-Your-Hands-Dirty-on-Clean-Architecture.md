I've been interested in software architecture, particularly in Clean Architecture, for many years.
I discovered this book a while ago and kept it on my reading list until recently, when I finally found the time
to read "Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture" by Tom Hombergs.

Hombergs combines Uncle Bobs Clean Architecture and the Hexagonal Architecture, which works well since they share many principles.
According to Hombers, the main focus of these architectures is maintainability, which the author considers to be the most important quality
of good software architecture.

The book provides practical guidelines on several topics, including the dependency rule, dependency inversion, and code organization.
Hombergs goes into detail on subjects that are less deeply covered in Robert C. Martin's "Clean Architecture" such as testing,
mapping between boundaries and managing multiple bounded contexts.

He also discusses shortcuts, when they might be appropriate and the risks they may involve.
This approach is practical and useful for real-world applications.

Although I didn't learn much new information after having read "Clean Architecture" twice and having conducted further research on my own,
I still found value in Hombergs' practical insights.

If you are new to Hexagonal Architecture and Clean Architecture, "Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture" is definitely worth reading.
It complements the concepts introduced by Uncle Bob with practical advice.

In summary, this book is a good resource for anyone looking to understand software architecture better.
Hombergs' focus on practical application and maintainability makes it a useful addition to any developer's library.

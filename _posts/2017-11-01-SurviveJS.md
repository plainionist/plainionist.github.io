After having spent the recent weeks and months getting deeper into web development and esp. into full stack micro services
(including non-monolith frontends) I realized that it is time to read a book about "client side development" in general to 
get a stronger foundation on state of the art development setups.

[SurviveJS - WebPack](https://www.amazon.com/SurviveJS-Webpack-apprentice-Juho-Veps%C3%A4l%C3%A4inen-ebook/dp/B06XWZZGBS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1509539830&sr=8-1&keywords=survivejs)

is the perfect match for that purpose. It gives a great overview on the challenges of client side development in 
general and solution proposals with WebPack specifically.

I strongly recommend this book for everyone planning to enter professional client side development.

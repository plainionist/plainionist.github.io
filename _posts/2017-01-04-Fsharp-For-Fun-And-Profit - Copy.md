title: The best source to learn F#
---

Some months back i started getting my hands dirty with F#. I started my journey with

[Real-World Functional Programming: With Examples in F# and C#](https://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Functional-Programming-Tomas-Petricek/dp/1933988924/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483534198&sr=8-1&keywords=real+world+functional+programming)

continued with

[The Book of F#: Breaking Free with Managed Functional Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Breaking-Managed-Functional-Programming/dp/1593275528/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483534245&sr=8-1&keywords=book+of+f%23)

and finally read the full 1900+ pages offline edition of

[F# for fun and profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/)

and i can clearly say:


**THIS IS THE BEST SOURCE TO LEARN F#**  -  ever!!

Thx Scott for this great blo

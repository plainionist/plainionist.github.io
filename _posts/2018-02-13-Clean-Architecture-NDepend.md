Today I found a nice article on the [NDepend Blog](https://blog.ndepend.com/):
[An Introduction To Clean Architecture](https://blog.ndepend.com/introduction-clean-architecture/).

The post gives a nice introduction by first motivating clean architecture by looking at the
short comings of the traditional layered approach. It then gives some history about the Clean Architecture.
Finally the post briefly introduces the Clean Architecture itself - the circles and the dependency rule.

It was a nice read - looking forward to read the follow-ups.

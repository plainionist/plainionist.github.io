If you think you don't have time, even not to learn and practice, here is the one book you need
to take time for:

I already had this book for nine months until I finally took the time to read it and I really enjoyed it!
For me, it is about inspiration, motivation and passion.

I cannot summarize the book in an appropriate way - not such that you can get inspired as much as I got - 
instead I will cite some of my favorites which hopefully quicken your appetite to read the book yourself:

> How it is done is as important as getting it done.

> Professionalism, technical excellence, and customer satisfaction are the main focus of
> Software Craftsmanship.
 
> First, building cars is totally different from building software. We do not use a car if it is not totally
> finished. We do not go back to the manufacturer after buying a car and ask them to add an extra door to it
> or to move the engine from the front to the back.

> If we think that a piece of code we wrote some time in the past is still good enough today,
> it means we didn't learn anything since.

> Time should never be used as an excuse for not doing certain things. Ever. We all have time. In fact,
> we all have exactly the same amount of time. The difference is how we choose to spend our time.

> Refactoring without pragmatism can be a dangerous practice. Being professional means to understand
> trade-offs. Although we want to make the whole system better, we may not need to.

> Quality is not expensive. The lack of skills is what makes well-crafted software expensive.

> Software craftsmen wake up in the morning to make things better and to change the world we live in.
> Being a software craftsman is far more than writing well-crafted code or being a software developer.
> It's a lifestyle - a commitment to excellence.

Motivated?

So get yourself a copy of that book! Read it! Become a software craftsman and change the world!

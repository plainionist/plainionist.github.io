This tiny little book 

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/MicroservicesArchitecture.jpg)

[Microservices architecture - Make the architecture of a software as simple as possible](https://www.amazon.com/Microservices-Architecture-architecture-software-possible/dp/153000053X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1484161399&sr=8-3&keywords=Microservices+architecture)

gives you a nice overview about different architectural patterns used in the microservices world.
This book is NOT an introduction of microservices - in fact it expects quite a bit knowledge about architecture and different 
technologies used in a microservices based system, e.g.: Docker, EC2, LoadBalancer, REST/HTTP ...

Still a valuable book if you want to have a short discussion (including pros and cons) about the following patterns:

- Monolithic architecture
- API gateway microservices architecture
- Client-side service discovery
- Server-side service discovery
- Service registry
- 3rd party registry
- Self registration
- Single service instance per host
- Multiple service instances per host
- Service instance per VM
- Service instance per container


I may not have spent the money for the paperback version but the kindle edition definitively has a fair price.

Looking for a short introduction into JavaScript?

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/YDKJS-Up&Going.jpg)

[You Don't Know JS: Up & Going](https://www.amazon.com/You-Dont-Know-JS-Going/dp/1491924462/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1487921052&sr=8-1&keywords=you+dont+know+js)

Eventhough the first part of the book is extremely low-level the second part gives a nice intro into the JavaScript language.

Obviously the author knows what he is talking about and probably i ll continue reading this series ...

Recently I read in [The week in .Net](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/tag/week-in-net/) about some new
e-books published by Microsoft about web, cloud and container development and one of these books was
[Architecting Modern Web Applications with ASP.NET Core and Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/aspnet-ebook).

After I have read it I can say it is a rather small book which gives you a good but very basic overview 
about ASP.Net Core MVC development.

<!--more-->

It "touches" the following topics:

- Traditional Web applications vs. Single Page Applications
- Architectural and design principles, e.g.:
  - separation of concerns
  - dependency inversion
  - persistence ignorance
- Common web architecture styles, like:
  - layers
  - clean architecture 
- Client side web technologies (e.g. Angular)
- How to setup your first ASP.NET Core MVC application
  - Structure the code
  - Design cross cutting concerns
  - Security
  - Caching
- How to use EF Core
- Testing Asp.net Core MVC applications
- Azure hosting

Definitively a good one if you are new to ASP.Net Core (MVC).

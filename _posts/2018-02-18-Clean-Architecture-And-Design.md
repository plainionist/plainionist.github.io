While preparing my next post on [Implementing Clean Architecture](/Implementing-Clean-Architecture) I watched again
Uncle Bobs famous talk on [Clean Architecture and Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsjsiz2A9mg).

I know it is more than three years old but if you are interested in Clean Architecture you should take your time and 
watch it. Uncle Bob explains nicely - and a little bit funny as usual ;-) - what the Clean Architecture is about, 
how the puzzle is built up and why it has to be like this.

And as a summary for this video and as an outlook to my next post here is the key message:

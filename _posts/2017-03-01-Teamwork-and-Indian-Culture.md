Eventhough I am working with Indian colleagues for some years now I only recently realized that I still don't know enough about the Indian culture 
in order to be able to understand certain motivation and behavior.

A quick search on Amazon discovered this small book:

[Teamwork & Indian Culture](https://www.amazon.com/Teamwork-Indian-Culture-Practical-Working/dp/1482566982/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488718358&sr=8-1&keywords=teamwork+and+indian+culture)

In a novel style the author describes several interesting aspects of the Indian culture which indeed helped me to understand things better.

Definitively worth reading if your work with Indian colleagues!

You can surely read a bunch of books about it like:

- [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483734195&sr=8-1&keywords=getting+things+done)
- [The 4-hour Workweek](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483734235&sr=8-1&keywords=4+hour+work)

OR you can just spend 30 minutes on watching this video:

- [Scaling your self - Scott Hanselman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS1mnISoG7U)

and you ll learn pretty much everything to get much more productive instantly.


I would just like to add two variants of "multitasking" to Scott's statement

- Delegation: you can get things done in parallel if you find someone else doing things for you
- Automation: if you find a software or a machine doing things for you, you can do something else in that time

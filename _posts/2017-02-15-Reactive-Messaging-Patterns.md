[Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model](https://www.amazon.com/Reactive-Messaging-Patterns-Actor-Model/dp/0133846830/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1487153776&sr=1-4-fkmr0&keywords=reactive+message)

Event hough this book gives a nice introduction into the Actor Model, Akka and Scala it finally is what the title states: a pattern book. 
And as every pattern book it doesn't read nicely from cover to cover.

The patterns are nicely described and many code samples are used to illustrate how to apply these patterns in practice.

The author very often refers to 

- [Implementing Domain-Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1487154184&sr=1-1&keywords=implementing+domain-driven+design)
- [Enterprise Integration Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Deploying/dp/0321200683/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1487154213&sr=1-1&keywords=enterprise+integration+patterns)

and I sometimes had the impression that this book just tries to show how to realize the ideas described in these two books with the 
Actor Model and Akka.

As I haven't read any of these books yet, for me it was a bit difficult to follow sometimes.

For me - being a "messaging solution", actor model and Akka newbie - this was the wrong book to start with.
I ll read some other Akka books first now, gain some practical experience, read at least "Implementing Domain-Driven Design" and will 
probably come back to this book again.

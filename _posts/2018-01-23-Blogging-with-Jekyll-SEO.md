Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is about helping Google to present your blog in the its search results. Lukily some 
[nice guys](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag) have written a Jekyll plugin which makes it very easy for you to 
do SEO for your Jekyll based blog.

There are just two things to be done:

1. Follow [Search engine optimization for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/search-engine-optimization-for-github-pages/)
2. Read [Jekyll SEO plugin usage](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/blob/master/docs/usage.md) and add at least
   a description to the YAML front matter of your posts

Check [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home) the next days how things have changed ...

[Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1513596353&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+architecture)

As with every book by Uncle Bob it was fun to read it ... so I finished it in 2 days ;-)

As the title states and in contrast to his other recent books this book is really focusing on architecture. 
He clearly describes what architecture is about and what good architecture is, from his perspective.

Having read his [Clean Architecture article](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) already 3 times for me 
there were no fundamental news in the book, but still gave me some more insights here and there.

So if you haven't studied "The Clean Architecture" already in detail the book is a must read! 
(what else? - it is by Uncle Bob! ;-) )

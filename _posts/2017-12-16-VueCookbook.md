As my expedition in the world of web development (esp. cient side web development) continued and my javascript and HTML codebase grew,
I discovered that I wanted a javascript framework to support me. After some research about Angular, KnockOut, React and Vue I finally 
decided for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). 

Eventhough the Vue online documentation is really great and gave me a good and quick start I later decided to look for a book
to gain an even better foundation. I finally selected

[Vue.js 2 Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Vue-js-2-Cookbook-Andrea-Passaglia/dp/1786468093/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1513430297&sr=8-1&keywords=vue+cookbook)

Being a cookbook it is not much comfortable to read it from cover to cover - nevertheless I decided to do so to get a broad overview
on Vue. 

Finally I conclude that this book is really a great extension to Vue's onlline documentation. The receipts cover broad range of topics from 
animations, over SPAs to large scale application patterns. Each receipt covers its topic to a good detail. Even as a Vue and JavaScript newbie
the book is an easy read.

If you want to extend your Vue knowledge past the online material go for this book!

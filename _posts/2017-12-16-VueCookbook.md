As my expedition in the world of web development (especially client side web development) continued and my 
JavaScript and HTML code base grew, I discovered that I wanted a JavaScript framework to support me. 
After some research about Angular, KnockOut, React and Vue.js I finally decided for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). 

Even though the Vue.js online documentation is really great and gave me a good and quick start I later decided
to look for a book to gain an even better foundation. I finally selected

[Vue.js 2 Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Vue-js-2-Cookbook-Andrea-Passaglia/dp/1786468093/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1513430297&sr=8-1&keywords=vue+cookbook)

Being a cookbook it is not much comfortable to read it from cover to cover - nevertheless I decided to do so
to get a broad overview on Vue.js. 

Finally I conclude that this book is really a great extension to Vue.js's online documentation. The receipts
cover broad range of topics from animations, over SPAs to large scale application patterns. Each receipt 
covers its topic to a good detail. Even as a Vue.js and JavaScript newbie the book is an easy read.

If you want to extend your Vue.js knowledge past the online material go for this book!

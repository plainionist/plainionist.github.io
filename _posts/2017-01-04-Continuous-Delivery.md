A week back i just finished reading

![Book: Continuous Delivery]({{ site.url }}/assets/ContinuousDelivery.jpg "Book: Continuous Delivery")

[Continuous Delivery](https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483707145&sr=8-1&keywords=continuous+delivery)

Also I sometimes wished it would be a hundred pages shorter I finally think it is a 
valuable book almost completely describing the topic.

==> If you are not doing Continuous Delivery yet: get a copy of this book, read it and apply the learnings 
    to your projects.

==> You want to try out these concepts in your private one-man projects? 
Have a look at [Plainion.CI](https://github.com/ronin4net/Plainion.CI/blob/master/README.md)


## Update

My major take-away: the approach of Continuous Delivery and the Deployment Pipeline allows you to truly work in an incremental and 
iterative way.

You do not need to have everything right at the beginning - you just need your basic pipeline working right from the beginning and 
then incrementally improve.

With a full automated pipeline pushing updates to your users is so easy that delivering small improvements, bug fixes and features 
becomes fun again ;-)

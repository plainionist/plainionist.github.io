## Must-Read

There are endless books out there teaching you how to become a better software developer and every year
new great books are added. But from my perspective these three books are still the fundament your 
craftsmanship needs to be based on.

- Learn how to work as a software craftsman from Andrew Hunt and David Thomas with
  [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452759962&sr=8-1&keywords=pragmatic+programmer)
  
- Learn how to craft code from "Uncle Bob" (Robert C. Martin) with
  [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452760030&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+code)
  
- Learn how to craft a software design from "Uncle Blob" with 
  [Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Principles-Patterns-Practices-C/dp/0131857258/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452784187&sr=8-1&keywords=agile+patterns+and+practices)

  
## Recommended Reading

The number of books I could recommend for reading is huge - there are so many things the learn!
Instead let me just name a few which - even after years - still belong to my personal favorites:

- [Refactoring](http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452760245&sr=8-1&keywords=refactoring) my Martin Fowler

- [The Art of Unit Testing](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Unit-Testing-examples/dp/1617290890/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452760456&sr=8-1&keywords=art+of+unit+testing) by Roy Osherove

- [The 7 habits of highly effective people](http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B00GOZV3TM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1452760557&sr=8-2&keywords=7+habits) by Stephen R. Covey


## Sharpening the saw

And now comes the most important part - now it is your turn. Being a software craftsman means continuous 
learning. There are of course many ways to learn but from my perspective reading books should be one of 
these.

Read at least 3 books about your craft each year ...

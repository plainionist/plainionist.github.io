is what you are looking for.

This book is not written for software developers - it is for management. It discusses research of the past years on software
delivery performance. It contains all the data, the analysis and the research you need to convince your management that these practices 
do excel "traditional software development" with respect to software delivery performance!

So give your boss a hint - it might be beneficial for you, your department and eventually for your whole organization ...

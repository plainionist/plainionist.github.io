Now that I have my basic blog running I want to tune it a little bit ...

## Tags

Every blog needs tags. This gives the reader an easy way to find content related posts. After some research i found this great post about
how to include tags in a Jekyll and GitHub Pages based blog:

[Jekyll Tags on Github Pages](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/)

I basically follow exactly this description for my blog.

Nothing to add ... ;-)


## Series

While tags allow connecting related blogs in an unstructured way, a "series of posts" have a clear ordering. 
This is not used as often as tagging but sometimes quite helpful to cut a longer story into shorter parts 
(usually no one wants to read a single blog post of 100 screen pages.)

Again after some research I decided to follow this nice post:

[Jekyll Part 13: Creating an Article Series](http://digitaldrummerj.me/blogging-on-github-part-13-creating-an-article-series/)

I again follow exactly this description for my blog and I am pretty much happy with it. 

Nothing to add ... again ... ;-)

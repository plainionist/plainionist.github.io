In order to get my hands even dirtier with Web technologies I wanted to read more about Html5, JavaScript and jQuery.
And so I came across this book:

[A Software Engineer Learns HTML5, JavaScript and jQuery](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineer-Learns-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1493692615/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1493896240&sr=8-4&keywords=jquery)
<!--more-->
It presents the topics

- Html5
- JavaScript language
- CSS3
- jQuery
- AJAX
 
and many more topics in a nice pragmatic way. Definitively after reading I had a good basic understanding of 
the technologies and felt ready to play around with some code - which I did successfully 2 days later ;-)

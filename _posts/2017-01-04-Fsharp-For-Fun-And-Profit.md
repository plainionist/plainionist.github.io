Some months back I started getting my hands dirty with F#. I wanted to figure out whether F# can help me
to become even more productive and deliver even better software.

I started my journey with

[Real-World Functional Programming: With Examples in F# and C#](https://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Functional-Programming-Tomas-Petricek/dp/1933988924/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483534198&sr=8-1&keywords=real+world+functional+programming)

continued it with

[The Book of F#: Breaking Free with Managed Functional Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Breaking-Managed-Functional-Programming/dp/1593275528/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483534245&sr=8-1&keywords=book+of+f%23)

and finally read the full 1900+ pages off-line edition of

[F# for fun and profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/)

and I can clearly say:

**THIS** is the best source to learn F# ever!! On these pages you will find everything about F#, from the 
simplest examples to the most advanced techniques.

Thanks Scott for this great blog!
